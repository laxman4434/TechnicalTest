# TechnicalTest

This purpose of this C# application is to calculate the optimal set of suppliers to purchase products from. ‘Optimal’ in this case means the cheapest set of suppliers that have sufficient stock. 

Your goal is to complete the PurchaseOptimizer.Optimize() method. 

Whilst the code challenge is only 1 question it is very complex. We recommend you spend plenty of time analyzing the depth of the task. Also, ensure you review all the properties of the Models and Database classes, taking note of important fields that may be relevant. Record any assumptions in a comment at the top of the PurchaseOptimizer class.

Expected Effort:

Whilst you will unlikely be able to produce a production-level solution in the assigned time-slot, we expect that 3-4 hours is sufficient to showcase your expertise.

Acceptance Criteria:

•	The Optimize() method should return a list of ‘optimal’ purchase orders that fulfil the purchase requirements. 
•	All required items must be included in the result, regardless of supplier availability.
•	A maximum of 1 purchase order per supplier should be created.
•	Print the results to the console.
